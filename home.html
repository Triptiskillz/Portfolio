          <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. 
          I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.
           I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to code,I like to playing Footboll,I like planting trees,I like to Cook and I love my environment(nature).
          <br>I always wanted to be a great Engineer, yet. I am just someone who does some study, some work, and some sports . But my dream is still alive.  </span></p>
